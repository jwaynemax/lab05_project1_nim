1. NimHelpDialog
	- Method showHelpDialog contains all code needed to show and interact with the help dialog. 
	- Added methods getShouldShowHelpDialog and setShouldShowHelpDialog to retrieve and/or set the current state of data field shouldShowHelpDialog from NimMenuBar
2. About
	- Directions state "About, which should display the date and your name on two different lines" 
		- I wasn't clear if this should be an alert or displayed on the app and if the data should be current or date the app was created
			- I created as an Alert so the user could quickly see the creator of the app and the current date
			- I set date to current so user could see current timestamp
7. FullNimPane 
	- Moved data fields for pnHumanPlayer, pnComputerPlayer, pnGameInfo, and pnChooseFirstPlayer to FullNimPane to ensure separation of concerns.
	- Added getters / setters for these fields to reference in NimMenuBar and NewGamePane to retrieve the current state of the pane for the current game
